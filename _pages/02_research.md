Screening mechanisms in theories of modified gravity.
I am studying screening mechanisms using analytical and numerical methods. My interest in this area is concentrated on applications to cosmological, astrophysical and laboratory configurations, both static and time dependent.

------

Quintessential inflation.
I am particularly interested in quintessential inflationary scenarios (inflation-dark energy connection). I have worked on a realization of this idea in the framework of inflationary alpha-attractors. In this context I am also interested in physics of reheating.

------

Late-universe cosmology.
Study of modified theories of gravity and their observable effects on large-scale structure. I have particularly worked on various aspects of massive gravity/bigravity models, infrared non-local modifications of gravity, multifield dark energy models. I have interest in studying the gravitational wave observations for constraining the modified gravity models.

------

Quantum field theories on backgrounds with boundaries and non-trivial topologies.
I am interested in generalized Randall-Sundrum-type models. I have particularly worked on investigating the properties of quantized scalar and fermionic fields in higher dimensional Randall-Sundrum models with compactified extra dimensions.

------

Other topics in cosmology and astrophysics.
I am in general interested in physics of high energy astrophysical sources, e.g. quasars/AGNs, neutron star binaries etc. Previously I have worked on quasar evolution.
