I am a cosmologist at Kavli IPMU. My work is mostly carried out in the research groups led by Misao Sasaki and Masahiro Takada. Prior to coming here I was a [de Sitter PhD fellow](http://leidendesitter.nl/de_Sitter/Welcome.html) at the [Lorentz Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/) and at [Sterrewacht Leiden](https://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) supervised by Ana Achucarro and Alessandra Silvestri. I have done my undergraduate studies at the faculty of physics of Yerevan State University, Armenia and my master studies at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg. For more details on my academic biography see [my CV](/files/Valeri_Vardanyan_CV.pdf). 


Besides the PhD research I have been a teaching assistant of several courses in Leiden, namely Effective Field Theory, Quantum Field Theory, Quantum Mechanics (Part 2) and Classical Electrodynamics. I have also co-supervised several master students.
