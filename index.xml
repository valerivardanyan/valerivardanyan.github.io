      <description>I am a cosmologist at Kavli IPMU. My work is mostly carried out in the research groups led by Misao Sasaki and Masahiro Takada. Prior to coming here I was a de Sitter PhD fellow at the Lorentz Institute of Theoretical Physics and at Sterrewacht Leiden supervised by Ana Achucarro and Alessandra Silvestri. I have done my undergraduate studies at the faculty of physics of Yerevan State University, Armenia and my master studies at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg.</description>

      <description>Screening mechanisms in theories of modified gravity. I am studying screening mechanisms using analytical and numerical methods. My interest in this area is concentrated on applications to cosmological, astrophysical and laboratory configurations, both static and time dependent.
 Quintessential inflation. I am particularly interested in quintessential inflationary scenarios (inflation-dark energy connection). I have worked on a realization of this idea in the framework of inflationary alpha-attractors. In this context I am also interested in physics of reheating.</description>
